As an organisation, we need to be customer focused – after all, customers are who we're here for, our reason for being. We want to provide them with the products and services they need: executing payments and other transactions, keeping and managing their money and savings and extending loans and making investments. Our aim is to do all that with an experience that is easy, instant, personal and relevant. We realise that different types of customers have different needs. We can make a difference by helping them to plan for the future and make informed financial decisions, and by providing suitable financial products and customised advice. Read more on how we cater to our customers’ needs, private individuals, small businesses and large corporates in 'Superior customer experience'.

**Putting sustainability at the heart of what we do**

We have a role in society to define new ways of doing business that align with economic changes, growth and social impact. Climate change is one of the world’s biggest challenges, threatening societies as we know them today. We’re determined to be a banking leader in building a sustainable future for customers, society and the environment. We want to lead by example by striving for net zero in our own operations. We also want to play our part in the low-carbon transformation that’s necessary to achieve a sustainable future, aiming to steer our financing towards meeting global climate goals and working with clients to achieve their own sustainability goals.

Since 2020, we have been executing our strategy of becoming a personal bank in the digital age for the resourceful and ambitious.

Our three strategic pillars act as our guiding principles in executing our strategy. The first pillar is customer experience, as we focus on attractive segments where we can grow by bringing convenience into the daily lives of our clients and expertise when it matters. Our second pillar is sustainability, where we aim to become the first-choice partner for our clients in sustainability, providing distinctive expertise in supporting their transition. And our third pillar is future-proof bank, enhancing client service, compliance and efficiency.

**Customer Experience – A personal bank in the digital age, for the resourceful and the ambitious**

**Our aim is to focus on market segments where we can grow profitably, bring convenience to daily banking and offer expertise to clients at moments that matter.** To that end, over the past few years we monitored, steered and set strategic targets on Net Promoter Score (NPS) and market share in two focus segments in the Netherlands: mortgages and SMEs.

Going forward, we will increasingly work with non-financial partners in for example SME lending, payments and investments, and develop digital asset capabilities to prepare for the transformation of the financial markets infrastructure.

**Sustainability** – distinctive expertise in supporting clients’ transition to sustainability

**Sustainability has been a core pillar of our strategy since 2018 and is an integral part of our business.** We aim to be our clients’ first-choice partner in sustainability, providing financing and expertise to help them transition towards more sustainable practices. As part of our climate strategy we have started working with clients to align with the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement.

Going forward, we will further integrate the sustainability transition into our business models, leveraging our current exposures and sector knowledge.

**Future-proof bank – Enhance client services, compliance and efficiency**

We are building a future-proof bank. To do this, we are enhancing client service, compliance, and efficiency, as well as simplifying and further centralising our organisation, reducing our cost base and streamlining our product offering. At the same time, we are working to protect client data, to help in the fight against cybercrime and to build a workforce fit for the future. We are fully committed to maintaining a strict risk focus.

Going forward, we are working to improve our client offering with simplified financial solutions, optimising the user experience as we move towards a modular architecture. This will enable us to reduce time-to-market, make it easier to work with partners and reduce maintenance costs."
Deutsche Bank;https://investor-relations.db.com/files/documents/annual-reports/2024/Annual-Report-2023.pdf;Deutsche Bank’s strategic and financial roadmap through 2025 aims to position Deutsche Bank as a Global Hausbank, and to achieve the bank’s 2025 financial targets and capital objectives. The Global Hausbank strategy is underpinned by three key themes: risk management, sustainability and technology, which have become even more important considering the ongoing geopolitical and macro-economic challenges. In this environment, Deutsche Bank aims to leverage a more favorable interest rate environment, deploy risk management expertise to support clients, and allocate capital to high-return growth opportunities. As sustainability becomes ever more important, the bank aims to deepen its dialogue with and support for clients and broaden the agenda in respect of the bank’s own operations. As technology continues to evolve, Deutsche Bank aims to achieve further cost savings, accelerate the transition to a digital bank and expand upon strategic partnerships, which are already creating substantial value. At the same time, Deutsche Bank continues to work towards a long-term set-up that will enable a future of sustainable growth. This includes a clear definition of its purpose, vision and culture.
