Since 2020, we have been executing our strategy of becoming a personal bank in the digital age for the resourceful and ambitious.\n\nOur three strategic pillars act as our guiding principles in executing our strategy. The first pillar is customer experience, as we focus on attractive segments where we can grow by bringing convenience into the daily lives of our clients and expertise when it matters. Our second pillar is sustainability, where we aim to become the first-choice partner for our clients in sustainability, providing distinctive expertise in supporting their transition. And our third pillar is future-proof bank, enhancing client service, compliance and efficiency.\n\n**Customer Experience \u2013 A personal bank in the digital age, for the resourceful and the ambitious**\n\n**Our aim is to focus on market segments where we can grow profitably, bring convenience to daily banking and offer expertise to clients at moments that matter.** To that end, over the past few years we monitored, steered and set strategic targets on Net Promoter Score (NPS) and market share in two focus segments in the Netherlands: mortgages and SMEs.\n\nGoing forward, we will increasingly work with non-financial partners in for example SME lending, payments and investments, and develop digital asset capabilities to prepare for the transformation of the financial markets infrastructure.\n\n**Sustainability** \u2013 distinctive expertise in supporting clients\u2019 transition to sustainability\n\n**Sustainability has been a core pillar of our strategy since 2018 and is an integral part of our business.** We aim to be our clients\u2019 first-choice partner in sustainability, providing financing and expertise to help them transition towards more sustainable practices. As part of our climate strategy we have started working with clients to align with the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement.\n\nGoing forward, we will further integrate the sustainability transition into our business models, leveraging our current exposures and sector knowledge.\n\n**Future-proof bank \u2013 Enhance client services, compliance and efficiency**\n\nWe are building a future-proof bank. To do this, we are enhancing client service, compliance, and efficiency, as well as simplifying and further centralising our organisation, reducing our cost base and streamlining our product offering. At the same time, we are working to protect client data, to help in the fight against cybercrime and to build a workforce fit for the future. We are fully committed to maintaining a strict risk focus.\n\nGoing forward, we are working to improve our client offering with simplified financial solutions, optimising the user experience as we move towards a modular architecture. This will enable us to reduce time-to-market, make it easier to work with partners and reduce maintenance costs."

In this environment, Deutsche Bank aims to leverage a more favorable interest rate environment, deploy risk management expertise to support clients, and allocate capital to high-return growth opportunities. As sustainability becomes ever more important, the bank aims to deepen its dialogue with and support for clients and broaden the agenda in respect of the bank\u2019s own operations.
